    "\n",
    "- How do I monitor and control Vertex AI, Workbench, and GCS costs day‑to‑day?\n",
    "- What *specifically* should I stop, delete, or schedule to avoid surprise charges?\n",
    "- How can I automate cleanup and set alerting so leaks get caught quickly?\n",

    "\n",
    "::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify all major cost drivers across Vertex AI (training jobs, endpoints, Workbench notebooks, batch prediction) and GCS.\n",
    "- Practice safe cleanup for **Managed** and **User‑Managed** Workbench notebooks, training/tuning jobs, batch predictions, models, endpoints, and artifacts.\n",
    "- Configure budgets, labels, and basic lifecycle policies to keep costs predictable.\n",
    "- Use `gcloud`/`gsutil` commands for auditing and rapid cleanup; understand when to prefer the Console.\n",
    "- Draft simple automation patterns (Cloud Scheduler + `gcloud`) to enforce idle shutdown.\n",

    "## What costs you money on GCP (quick map)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vertex AI training jobs** (Custom Jobs, Hyperparameter Tuning Jobs) — billed per VM/GPU hour while running.\n",
    "- **Vertex AI endpoints (online prediction)** — billed per node‑hour *24/7 while deployed*, even if idle.\n",
    "- **Vertex AI batch prediction jobs** — billed for the job’s compute while running.\n",
    "- **Vertex AI Workbench notebooks** — the backing VM and disk bill while running (and disks bill even when stopped).\n",
    "- **GCS buckets** — storage class, object count/size, versioning, egress, and request ops.\n",
    "- **Artifact Registry** (containers, models) — storage for images and large artifacts.\n",
    "- **Network egress** — downloading data out of GCP (e.g., to your laptop) incurs cost.\n",
    "- **Logging/Monitoring** — high‑volume logs/metrics can add up (rare in small workshops, real in prod).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Rule of thumb: **Endpoints left deployed** and **notebooks left running** are the most common surprise bills in education/research settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A daily “shutdown checklist” (use now, automate later)\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Workbench notebooks** — stop the runtime/instance when you’re done.  \n",
    "2) **Custom/HPT jobs** — confirm no jobs stuck in `RUNNING`.  \n",
    "3) **Endpoints** — undeploy models and delete unused endpoints.  \n",
    "4) **Batch predictions** — ensure no jobs queued or running.  \n",
    "5) **Artifacts** — delete large intermediate artifacts you won’t reuse.  \n",
    "6) **GCS** — keep only one “source of truth”; avoid duplicate datasets in multiple buckets/regions.\n",
