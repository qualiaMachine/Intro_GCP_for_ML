    "## Setting up our notebook environment\n",
    "Google Cloud Workbench provides JupyterLab-based environments that can be used to orchestrate machine learning workflows. In this workshop, we will use a **Workbench Instance**—the recommended option going forward, as other Workbench environments are being deprecated.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> Workbench Instances come with JupyterLab 3 pre-installed and are configured with GPU-enabled ML frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.), making it easy to start experimenting without additional setup. Learn more in the [Workbench Instances documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/instances/introduction?_gl=1*r0g0e9*_ga*MTczMzg4NDE1OC4xNzU4MzEyMTE0*_ga_WH2QY8WWF5*czE3NTg1NTczMzkkbzMkZzEkdDE3NTg1NjIxNzgkajI3JGwwJGgw).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the notebook as a controller\n",
    "The notebook instance functions as a *controller* to manage more resource-intensive tasks. By selecting a modest machine type (e.g., `n1-standard-4`), you can perform lightweight operations locally in the notebook while using the **Vertex AI Python SDK** to launch compute-heavy jobs on larger machines (e.g., GPU-accelerated) when needed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach minimizes costs while giving you access to scalable infrastructure for demanding tasks like model training, batch prediction, and hyperparameter tuning.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will follow these steps to create our first Workbench Instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Navigate to Workbench\n",
    "- In the Google Cloud Console, search for \"Workbench.\"  \n",
    "- Click the \"Instances\" tab (this is the supported path going forward).  \n",
    "- Pin Workbench to your navigation bar for quick access.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Create a new Workbench Instance\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Initial settings\n",
    "- Click **Create New** near the top of the Workbench page\n",
    "- **Name**: For this workshop, we can use the following naming convention to easily locate our notebooks: `teamname-yourname-purpose` (e.g., sinkorswim-johndoe-train)\n",
    "- **Region**: Choose the same region as your storage bucket (e.g., `us-central1`). This avoids cross-region transfer charges and keeps data access latency low.\n",
    "    - If you are unsure, check your bucket's location in the Cloud Storage console (click the bucket name → look under \"Location\").\n",
    "- **Zone:** `us-central1-a` (or another zone in `us-central1`, like `-b` or `-c`)  \n",
    "  - If capacity or GPU availability is limited in one zone, switch to another zone in the same region.\n",
    "- **NVIDIA T4 GPU:** Leave unchecked for now  \n",
    "  - We will request GPUs for training jobs separately. Attaching here increases idle costs.\n",
    "- **Apache Spark and BigQuery Kernels:** Leave unchecked  \n",
    "  - Enable only if you specifically need Spark or BigQuery notebooks; otherwise, it adds unnecessary images.\n",
    "- **Network in this project:** Required selection  \n",
    "  - This option must be selected; shared environments do not allow using external or default networks.  \n",
    "  - This ensures your instance connects to the shared VPC for the workshop.\n",
    "- **Network / Subnetwork:**  Leave as pre-filled.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Machine type**: Select a small machine (e.g., `e2-standard-2`) to act as the controller.  \n",
    "  - This keeps costs low while you delegate heavy lifting to training jobs.  \n",
    "  - For guidance on common machine types for ML, refer to [Instances for ML on GCP](../instances-for-ML.html).\n",

    "\n",
    "- Training a model on a GPU-backed instance.  \n",
    "- Running hyperparameter tuning jobs managed by Vertex AI.  \n",

    "The notebook serves as a lightweight control plane.  \n",
    "- Like an HPC login node, it is not meant for heavy computation.  \n",
