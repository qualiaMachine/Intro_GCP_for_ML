    "## Testing train.py locally in the notebook\n",
    "Before scaling training jobs onto managed resources, it's essential to test your training script locally. This prevents wasting GPU/TPU time on bugs or misconfigured code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Guidelines for testing ML pipelines before scaling\n",
    "- **Run tests locally first** with small datasets.  \n",
    "- **Use a subset of your dataset** (1–5%) for fast checks.  \n",
    "- **Start with minimal compute** before moving to larger accelerators.  \n",
    "- **Log key metrics** such as loss curves and runtimes.  \n",
    "- **Verify correctness first** before scaling up.  \n",
    "\n",
    "::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "### What tests should we do before scaling?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Before scaling to multiple or more powerful instances (e.g., GPUs or TPUs), it's important to run a few sanity checks. **In your group, discuss:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Which checks do you think are most critical before scaling up?  \n",

    "::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: solution\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data loads correctly** – dataset loads without errors, expected columns exist, missing values handled.  \n",
    "- **Overfitting check** – train on a tiny dataset (e.g., 100 rows). If it doesn't overfit, something is off.  \n",
    "- **Loss behavior** – verify training loss decreases and doesn't diverge.  \n",
    "- **Runtime estimate** – get a rough sense of training time on small data.  \n",
    "- **Memory estimate** – check approximate memory use.  \n",
    "- **Save & reload** – ensure model saves, reloads, and infers without errors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Skipping these can lead to: silent data bugs, runtime blowups at scale, inefficient experiments, or broken model artifacts.  \n",
