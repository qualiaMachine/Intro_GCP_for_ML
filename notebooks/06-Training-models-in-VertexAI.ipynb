    "::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the XGBoost Training Script (GCP version)\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a moment to review the `train_xgboost.py` script we’re using on GCP found in `Intro_GCP-for_ML/scripts/train_xgboost.py`. This script handles preprocessing, training, and saving an XGBoost model, while supporting **local paths** and **GCS (`gs://`) paths**, and it adapts to **Vertex AI** conventions (e.g., `AIP_MODEL_DIR`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Try answering the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data preprocessing**: What transformations are applied to the dataset before training?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Training function**: What does the `train_model()` function do? Why print the training time?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Command-line arguments**: What is the purpose of `argparse` in this script? How would you change the number of training rounds?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Handling local vs. GCP runs**: How does the script let you run the same code locally, in Workbench, or as a Vertex AI job? Which environment variable controls where the model artifact is written?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Training and saving the model**: What format is the dataset converted to before training, and why? How does the script save to a local path vs. a `gs://` destination?\n",
    "\n",
    "After reviewing, discuss any questions or observations with your group.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: solution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data preprocessing**: The script fills missing values (`Age` with median, `Embarked` with mode), maps categorical fields to numeric (`Sex` → {male:1, female:0}, `Embarked` → {S:0, C:1, Q:2}), and drops non-predictive columns (`Name`, `Ticket`, `Cabin`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Training function**: `train_model()` constructs and fits an XGBoost model with the provided parameters and prints wall-clock training time. Timing helps compare runs and make sensible scaling choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Command-line arguments**: `argparse` lets you set hyperparameters and file paths without editing code (e.g., `--max_depth`, `--eta`, `--num_round`, `--train`). To change rounds:  `python train_xgboost.py --num_round 200`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Handling local vs. GCP runs**:  \n",
    "   - **Input**: You pass `--train` as either a local path (`train.csv`) or a GCS URI (`gs://bucket/path.csv`). The script automatically detects `gs://` and reads the file directly from Cloud Storage using the Python client.  \n",
    "   - **Output**: If the environment variable `AIP_MODEL_DIR` is set (as it is in Vertex AI CustomJobs), the trained model is written there—often a `gs://` path. Otherwise, the model is saved in the current working directory, which works seamlessly in both local and Workbench environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Training and saving the model**:  \n",
    "   The training data is converted into an **XGBoost `DMatrix`**, an optimized format that speeds up training and reduces memory use. The trained model is serialized with `joblib`. When saving locally, the file is written directly to disk. If saving to a Cloud Storage path (`gs://...`), the model is first saved to a temporary file and then uploaded to the specified bucket.\n",

    "Before scaling training jobs onto managed resources, it's essential to test your training script locally. This prevents wasting GPU/TPU time on bugs or misconfigured code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Guidelines for testing ML pipelines before scaling\n",
    "- **Run tests locally first** with small datasets.  \n",
    "- **Use a subset of your dataset** (1–5%) for fast checks.  \n",
    "- **Start with minimal compute** before moving to larger accelerators.  \n",
    "- **Log key metrics** such as loss curves and runtimes.  \n",
    "- **Verify correctness first** before scaling up.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What tests should we do before scaling?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Before scaling to multiple or more powerful instances (e.g., GPUs or TPUs), it's important to run a few sanity checks. Skipping these can lead to: silent data bugs, runtime blowups at scale, inefficient experiments, or broken model artifacts.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a non-exhaustive list of suggested tests to perform before scaling up your compute needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data loads correctly** – dataset loads without errors, expected columns exist, missing values handled.  \n",
    "- **Overfitting check** – train on a tiny dataset (e.g., 100 rows). If it doesn't overfit, something is off.  \n",
    "- **Loss behavior** – verify training loss decreases and doesn't diverge.  \n",
    "- **Runtime estimate** – get a rough sense of training time on small data.  \n",
    "- **Memory estimate** – check approximate memory use.  \n",
    "- **Save & reload** – ensure model saves, reloads, and infers without errors.  \n",
    "\n",
